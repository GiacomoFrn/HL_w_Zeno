## Code Overview

### Simulation Code

- **`hl_w_zeno_TN.py`** — main simulation script for Hamiltonian learning from repeated projective measurements.  
- **`utilities.py`** — helper functions for state evolution, measurement operations, and data handling.  
- **`tutorial.ipynb`** — interactive notebook demonstrating the full workflow: setup → simulation → analysis.  
- **`environment.yml`** — conda environment setup file.

### IBM Quantum Experiments (`IBM_experiment/`)

- **`execute_hamiltonian_learning.ipynb`** — performs Hamiltonian learning on IBM Quantum backends.  
- **`execute_montecarlo_resampling.ipynb`** — applies Monte Carlo resampling to estimate uncertainties from experimental data.  
- **`plot_color_map.ipynb`** — visualizes experimental results as color maps for easier interpretation.
